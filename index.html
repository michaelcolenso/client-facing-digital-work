<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3"><strong>Cloudmunch:</strong>  I worked on building a DevOps management tool for enterprise customers. It was primarily a client-side JavaScript app (PHP backend), built with Backbone.js, Sass and Grunt, and unfortunately I can’t send you a link because it’s yet to be publicly released (and I signed an NDA).</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Here’s a screenshot, though:</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10"><strong>Adonit:</strong> Adonit builds and sells <a href="http://www.adonit.net/jot/">digital styluses</a>. (I actually prefer <em>stylii</em> as the plural, but it maybe sounds kind of pretentious…).</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">During my time there I collaborated with a small distributed team (myself, another dev, a designer, and a PM) to implement a complete re-architecture, redesign, and rebuild of Adonit’s marketing and e-commerce web applications from WordPress to the Shopify platform. From an engineering standpoint, we focused on speed and performance (combined Shopify’s checkout processing with our own static product catalog pages), and it paid off with measurable improvements in engagements, conversions, and ultimately, revenue. <a href="http://www.adonit.net/">You can see our completed work here.</a></p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="16"><strong>CP+B:</strong> At <a href="http://www.cpbgroup.com/">Crispin Porter + Bogusky</a>, a rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crispin_Porter_%2B_Bogusky">notorious</a> global advertising agency, the most visible projects I worked on were probably <a href="applebees.com">applebees.com</a> and <a href="arbys.com">arbys.com</a>. Both were large, complex sites using a variety of technologies on the front and back-ends. My work on these sites was mostly maintenance, bugfixes, and a hodgepodge of minor feature updates or marketing/content work.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18">I was also lucky enough during my time at CP+B to be involved with a project called <a href="http://black.thegifys.com/">“The Gifys”</a>, which was conceived of by some creatives in the LA office as the “world’s first award show for the animated GIF”. The agency generously gave what was initially a side project a degree of official support and devoted some resources to building and <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=the+gifys&amp;safe=off">promoting</a> it, and it turned out awesome.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">The site (which I built with Node/Express) was even a <a href="http://webbyawards.com/winners/2014/web/general-website/weird/the-gifys/">2014 Webby Award Winner</a>. It was a super fun and rewarding collaboration with smart, funny, and creative people, and is one of my favorite things I’ve made on the internet.</p>
